# parking_lots_OOPS
This is a simple object-oriented parking lot system implemented in Python and (later) in C++. This is a mini project to implement the understanding how OOPS work in Python and C++.
It supports multiple vehicle types, slot assignment, and fare calculation.

## Features
- Class-based vehicle hierarchy: Car, Bike, Bus
- Slot allocation and release
- Entry and exit time logging
- Fare calculation (to be implemented)
- Ticket generation (to be implemented)

## Goals
- Learn and demonstrate OOP design differences between Python and C++
- Build a well-structured, clean, and modular system

## Project Structure
- `python/` : Python implementation
- `cpp/` : C++ implementation (coming soon)
